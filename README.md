## JavaScript 211 Project: Mastermind

### Today's Checklist

Create a new branch called "masterMind" from the repo JS211_Mastermind

Spec 0 - Define a test solution: Helpful suggestion: while developing you can set a default solution for you to test against. At the top of mastermind(), simply set const solution = 'abcd'; as a global variable.

Spec 1 - Detect a correct solution: In mastermind(), if the guess you passed in equals the solution, return 'You guessed it!';

Spec 2 - Generate a hint: generateHint() should take one argument, guess.

Spec 2.1 - Split up the solution and guess: In generateHint(), create variables solutionArray and guessArray that each split up passed in arguments, .splitting on '' (empty string).

Spec 2.2 - Determine correct "letter-locations": Create a variable correctLetterLocations and set it to 0. This variable will record how many correct "letter-locations" were guessed. For instance, a guess of aabc against a solution of deba would yield one correct "letter-location" (b). In a for loop, iterate over the solutionArray, comparing each index of solutionArray against the same index of guessArray. If the item matches, increment correctLetterLocations, and set that index in solutionArray to null.

Spec 2.3 - Determine correct "letters": Now that we have nulled the already counted correctLetterLocations, we can see if the guessArray contains any correctLetters that were not in the correct location. Set a variable correctLetters equal to 0, and in a for loop, again iterate over the solutionArray. Using .indexOf, determine if the item at the current index in guessArray appears inside of solutionArray. Save that index in a variable called targetIndex. Now, if targetIndex is greater than -1, increment correctLetters and set the item in solutionArray at that index equal to null.

Spec 2.4 - return hint string: Optionally, you can use the colors package, return a string that prints out the hints you generated, with correctLetterLocations being red, correctLetters being white, and separated by a hyphen. (NOTE If you choose to use this color package, only console.log the result. If you return the result your program will fail the tests.)

Spec 3 - Add guess and hint to the board: Define a variable called hint that collects the returned value of generateHint(guess). .push the guess and the hint (as a combined string) into the board.

Spec 4 - End the game: After 10 incorrect guesses, if the board length equals 10, return 'You ran out of turns! The solution was ' and the solution. Otherwise, return 'Guess again.'.

### Hints

1. Run your unit tests first!!
1. Use [repl.it](https://www.repl.it) to write the solution code first. (its a faster environment vs using the `node main.js` command over and over again.)
1. Read the comments in `main.js`
1. Use the [JS Docs at W3S](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_split.asp)
1. Push yourself further.
1. Look at your hints!
1. **Clone, setup, testing, and running instructions for all projects is below**

******

## Cloning Your Project

1. Click the 'Fork' button (choose your account if prompted).
1. Copy HTTPS URL from your forked repository
1. In your terminal/gitBash/CommandPrompt navigate (using `cd`) into a directory where you want to start keeping your repositories. (`/jsDevFolder`)
1. Clone your new repository by typing `git clone <forked clone URL>` (the HTTPS
URL you copied above)
  ![Forking a repository](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1tYsLHaLo8JRdp0xC1EZrAo0o9Wvv4S5AD937cokVOBk/pub?w=960&h=720)
1. Now go into the new directory by using `cd project-repo`

1. Add the base repository as an upstream
    `git remote add upstream https://github.com/AustinCodingAcademy/<PROJECT-REPO>.git`

1. Check the configuration of your remotes with `git remote -v`, it should look
very similar to this (except it'll be YOUR username)

```bash
$ git remote -v

origin  git@github.com:username/javascript-workbook.git (fetch)
origin  git@github.com:username/javascript-workbook.git (push)
upstream    git@github.com:AustinCodingAcademy/javascript-workbook.git (fetch)
upstream    git@github.com:AustinCodingAcademy/javascript-workbook.git (push)
```

### Setup

1. From your project directory, run `npm i` to tell NPM to install all the
node modules we use in this class (see `package.json`)
1. Use your textEditor (VS Code) to change your files.
1. When you're finished `git status`, stage your file `git add .`, commit your changes `git commit -m "functions working"`, and push to
GitHub `git push`
    ```bash
    git status
    git add .
    git commit -m "Initial Commit"
    git push origin gh-pages
    ```

1. Now go to your forked repository on GitHub (at
  https://github.com/your-username/javascript-workbook). A little yellow box
  should have popped up asking you to make a Pull Request. Click to review.

1. Click "Create Pull Request"

1. Every time you make a change *and push to GitHub*, this PR will automatically
update. No need to do it more than once.

#### Get latest workbook updates

1. To get the latest code/homework/test updates, be sure to have a "clean
working directory" by committing or removing all of your changes. You check for
a "clean working environment" by running `git status` and making sure no files
show up.

1. Run `git pull upstream gh-pages`

### Running the apps

Simply run `node path/to/file.js`

example `node 01week/rockPaperScissors.js`

### Running Tests

Tests are a great way to make sure you code works the way you planned it would,
and to make sure you don't break something in the future. We will be using them
to test our understanding of the lesson. It's also our main way to assign grades
for an assignment.

To run a the tests on a file run `npm test path/to/file.js`, etc.

### Running the Linter

Simply run `npm run lint`

#### Running the Server

1. Run `npm start`
1. To break out of the server, press `ctrl` + `c`
